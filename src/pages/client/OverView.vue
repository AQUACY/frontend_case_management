            As of June 1st, 2023 between 5:00 PM (ET) and the USCIS was more mindful of the U.S.
            citizen matter. USCIS Basic Protection Act (UBPA) introduced and U.S. Audit under the
            King Hall law set up. Please note that regarding Premium Processing Service, you may
            transfer the processing time of your I-140 petition. If the PP effort you provide has:
            Your priority date should be transferred to the USCIS Office within 15 days. The USCIS
            Office within NIW PP has UBPA approved your case. However, the U.S. granted through
            Premium Processing Service will set specific the wait time for your EAD priority date to
            become current. You will still need to wait for your priority date to become current in
            order to proceed with the second step of adjustment of status.
          </p>
          <p>
            For premium processing fees for premium processing, the fee from November 23, 2023:

          Important Notice Regarding Your Stay in the U.S.
        </h6>
        <div class="pl-3">
          <p>
            If you are out of status or your immigrant visa status has expired, it is important to
            note that you may be in the process of extending your status, or you have left the U.S.
            (please update your client record).
          </p>
          <p>
            To stay in the U.S., you need to maintain a valid visa status or file I-485 (adjustment
            of status), which is the second step of your green card application. If you are out of
            status for more than 180 days, you may be ineligible to file AOS and may have to leave
            the U.S.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note: After you file I-485, you are allowed to stay in the U.S. based on the pending
            I-485 and eligible for Employment Authorization Document (EAD). The current I-765
            processing time for an EAD is around 6-8 months on average and can be longer. Make sure
            to submit or update the I-485 EAD processing time reminder.
          </p>
          <p>
            Due to current USCIS policy, if you are in the U.S. on a valid nonimmigrant visa status
            (e.g., F-1, H-1B, J-1, etc.), your nonimmigrant visa status will be invalidated on your
            filing date of your pending I-485 to stay in the U.S. In addition, if your non-immigrant
            visa status expires and you do not file another visa such as H1B/H-4, O-1/O-2, J-1,
            before your visa expires, you can only file for AOS if based on the pending I-485. If
            you plan to stay in the U.S. based on your pending I-485, be sure to file I-765 (EAD)
            and I-131 (AP) with your I-485.

          NIW Adjudication Trends
        </h6>
        <div class="pl-3">
          <p>
            We would like to provide an update on NIW adjudication trends. Recently, we have noticed
            that immigration officers have started to issue a higher number of RFEs (Request for
            Evidence) or even denials to applications whose last peer-reviewed publications date a
            few years ago. These have challenged whether the clients are well positioned to advance
            their research endeavor and will make substantial contributions to the U.S. in the
            foreseeable future.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite being a self-petition case, NIW petitions are still subject to USCIS officers'
            discretion. To better position your case for approval, we strongly advise that you
            continue your research activities before we file your NIW petition. We have also
            observed that USCIS officers may consult Google Scholar exclusively to determine your
            publication record, so we encourage you to update your Google Scholar profile with your
            complete published papers to demonstrate your continued research efforts. It is not
            essential to wait for the publication of a new research paper before submitting your NIW
            petition.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are still waiting and may want to delay the publication to wait for your NIW
            petition, we encourage you to publish papers as soon as obtainable with your previous
            PhD group/other research institutions and continue publishing. In the near future, we
            suggest you regularly check your Google Scholar profile to ensure it reflects your most
            recent publications.
